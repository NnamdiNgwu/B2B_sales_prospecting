## Configuration

### 1. secrets.yaml

This file contains sensitive information like your email credentials and LLM API keys. **Never share or commit this file to version control.**

-   `email_address: [Your business email address]`
-   `email_password: [Your email password or app-specific password]`
-   `llm_api_key: [Your OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini API key]`
    -   To obtain an API key, refer to the official documentation for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), [Anthropic (Claude)](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), or [Google (Gemini)](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).
    -   **Note:** For OpenAI, you need to add credit to your account to use the API. A free-tier account has strict rate limits that may cause errors.

### 2. config.yaml

This file defines your prospecting parameters and bot behavior.

-   `target_roles:` A list of job titles to target (e.g., "Chief Technology Officer", "VP of Sales").
-   `target_industries:` A list of industries to focus on (e.g., "Software Development", "Financial Services").
-   `target_locations:` A list of geographic locations to search within.
-   `contact_once_per_company: [True/False]` Set to `True` to contact only one prospect per company.
-   `company_blacklist:` A list of companies to exclude from your search.
-   `title_blacklist:` A list of keywords in job titles to avoid (e.g., "Intern", "Assistant").
-   `llm_model_type`: Choose the model provider: `openai`, `ollama`, `claude`, or `gemini`.
-   `llm_model`: Specify the model name (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`).

### 3. contact_form_config.yaml

This file maps field names found on website contact forms to the data used to fill them. This allows the bot to correctly fill out forms on different websites.

-   `field_mappings:`
    -   `first_name:` List of possible HTML `name` attributes for the first name field (e.g., `['fname', 'first_name']`).
    -   `last_name:` List for the last name field.
    -   `email:` List for the email field.
    -   `phone:` List for the phone number field.
    -   `company:` List for the company name field.
    -   `message:` List for the main message/comment box.
-   `submit_button_selectors:` A list of CSS selectors or text to identify the form submission button.

## Usage

1.  **Configure Your Campaign:**
    Ensure your `data_folder` contains correctly filled-out `secrets.yaml`, `config.yaml`, and `contact_form_config.yaml` files.

2.  **Run the Bot:**
    Execute the main script to start your outreach campaign. The bot will use your configuration to find prospects, generate personalized messages, and contact them.
    ```bash
    python run_contact_campaign.py
    ```

3.  **Scrape-Only Mode:**
    To collect prospect data without sending any messages, run in scrape-only mode. This is useful for building lead lists for manual review.
    ```bash
    python run_contact_campaign.py --scrape-only
    ```

4.  **Review Output:**
    The `output/` directory will contain JSON files tracking the campaign's progress:
    -   `prospects.json`: A list of all identified prospects.
    -   `contacted.json`: Prospects that were successfully contacted.
    -   `failed.json`: Outreach attempts that failed.
    -   `skipped.json`: Prospects that were skipped due to blacklisting or other rules.

## Troubleshooting

#### 1. LLM API Rate Limit Errors
-   **Solution:** Check your API billing settings and usage limits on your provider's dashboard (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). If you are on a free tier, consider upgrading or adding credits to increase your rate limits.

#### 2. Contact Form Submission Errors
-   **Issue:** The bot fails to fill or submit a website's contact form.
-   **Solution:** Websites have unique form structures. Update your `contact_form_config.yaml` with the correct `name` attributes and selectors for the target website's form fields and submit button. Inspect the website's HTML to find these values.

#### 3. Bot Fails to Find Prospects
-   **Issue:** The bot runs but doesn't find any leads.
-   **Solution:**
    -   Broaden your search criteria in `config.yaml` (e.g., add more roles or locations).
    -   Ensure your configuration files are correctly formatted and complete.
